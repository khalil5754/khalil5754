- 👋 Hi, I’m Khalil
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, data science, and bayesian statistics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop a backtesting machine learning model to predict recession probability.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Ask me what project I'm working on right now or suggest something you are :).

Yesterday someone asked me how my summer's been. "Tough." I responded, before I really had a chance to process the question. "I've been coding in
Universities all over Ontario like some kind of nomad programmer, and I've been working on writing a (hopefully) publishable research paper". A month in
the season and I wasn't even aware it was summer yet - the lack of snow being my only real hint. "Watcha code?" - my mind drew a blank, it felt like
I had spent an eternity in VSCode over the past 6 months, but I didn't really "build" anything besides an unholy amount of visualizations and statistical 
analyses. 
"Mostly stuff for my paper".

So I woke up today planning to find a way showcase what it was I have done so far this year. If for no other reason than my own sanity.
Maybe this can serve as something like a post-diary. I may not have had the most jam-packed summer, but it was certainly dense with content.
